\section{Results}
We enabled the robot to grasp the cylinder at random positions and throw it with a set of synaptic weights generated by the evolutionary algorithm.
However the problems described in section \ref{problems} made it very hard to learn anything.
The individuals of the evolutionary algorithm executed throws but due to non-deterministic behaviour of the simulation the measured distance sometimes differed a lot from the quality of the movement.
The non-determinism also made it hard to compare the results as the same individual gets different distances if you execute it multiple times.
That resulted in the algorithm not really learning anything and evolving the weights rather randomly.
