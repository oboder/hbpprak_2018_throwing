\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We enabled the robot to grasp the cylinder at random positions and throw it using a set of synaptic weights generated by the evolutionary algorithm.
However the problems described in \autoref{sec:problems} make it very hard to learn anything.
The individuals of the evolutionary algorithm can execute throws but due to glitches in the simulation, like the shaking hand, the measured distance is not representative for the quality of the movement.
In addition the non-determinism in the simulation makes it hard to compare the results as the same individual gets different distances if executed multiple times.
That results in the algorithm not really learning anything and evolving the weights rather randomly.
