\section{Results}
We enabled the robot to grasp the cylinder at random positions and throw it with a set of synaptic weights generated by the evolutionary algorithm.
However the problems described in \autoref{sec:problems} made it very hard to learn anything.
The individuals of the evolutionary algorithm executed throws but due to glitches in the simulation the measured distance sometimes differed a lot from the quality of the movement.
In addition non-determinism in the simulation made it hard to compare the results as the same individual gets different distances if executed multiple times.
That resulted in the algorithm not really learning anything and evolving the weights rather randomly.
