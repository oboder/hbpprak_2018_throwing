\section{Problems}\label{sec:problems}
While working on the challenge we experienced some problems with the neurorobotics platform itself as well as the infrastructure around it provided to us.
The simulations in the neurorobotics platform are non-deterministic which leads to non-reproducible results.
This non-determinism probably results from floating point inaccuracy.
In addition to that the grasping of the cylinder is very unreliable.
If the cylinder is grasped too tightly the robot starts shaking, sometimes resulting in the hand exploding and the cylinder flying huge distances (see \autoref{fig:dispersed}).
In some extreme cases the hole table the robot is mounted to moves which results in the grasping not working afterwards.
We also had problems with the platform crashing regularly because of different reasons.
All these problems occurred on the server install of the platform.
In absence of a working local install we couldn't check if they were specific to the server install or the platform itself.
