\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\todo{}
Two different approaches are presented to make the robot arm throwing the cylinder.
The first approach controls the robot arm with hard-coded configurations which have been determined empirically.
This not only involves the static movements of the robot, but also grasping the cylinder at random positions reliably which is computed with inverse kinematics.
The second approach aims for a learned solution based on spiking neural networks.
For this purpose, an evolutionary algorithm has been chosen in order to optimize the synaptic weights.
Given the circumstances, various approaches have been implemented that lead to reasonably results.
However, results are not comparable due to non-deterministic behavior.
